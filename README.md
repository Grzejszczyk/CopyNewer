# CopyNewer
Copy new files if the were updated.

If you need copy (update) files in slave directory from master directory where files were updated this app do this job for you.

1. Select source directory.
2. Select destination directory.
3. Copy files (click button):
Then app will:
- create files list from destination (to know which files needs to be updated / copied)
- check if in source directory file exist
- copy this file (with overwriten property)
- finally app wil show how many files were copied and save list of copied files in destination directory as result.txt

Usefull when it is needed to share specified files in different directory than master.
I am using it to update CAD data in Shared Folder for specifed people.
